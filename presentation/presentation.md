# Overview

Set out to explore, evaluate and prototype technologies for authx infra.

Our current prototype setup accomplishes the following:

+ **Centralised authn (i.e. SSO):** Apps can integrate with SSO with minimal
  effort -- they just need to register their app on the API gateway without
  client libraries. 

+ **Mostly centralised authz with some decentralisation:** Want centralised
  authz so a user's group, roles and privileges follows them whether they're
  using apps via the browser, or calling APIs via curl. 

> At the same time, want flexibility for teams to add on additional
decentralised authz policies where needed (e.g. k2o implementing app-level
permissions that wouldn't be feasible to manage centrally).

---

# Proposal

+ Use OAuth for authorization, and OpenID Connect for authentication 

> (TLDR: Token-based authorization)

---

### Why OAuth over CAS?

+ OAuth is a highly popular authorization framework, which gives us
    + Good library support in many languages
    + More resources online if we need development assistance
+ OAuth is stable, yet still under heavy development - protocols continue to be
  built on top of OAuth
    + OpenID Connect, which is itself already very stable
    + Token Exchange - an example of how people found unsupported use cases, and
      extended the framework to support more cases
    + User Managed Access, which we might need in the future
+ OAuth has a well-defined specification, and this specification has been
  publicly reviewed
    + Takes the form of RFCs
    + There are even reviews of the threat model and documented security
      consideration (RFC 6819)

???

+ Shows the attention people have given to security in this framework

---

### Usage

<center><img src="00-key-shift.svg" width="80%" /></center>

???
+ The use of tokens for authorization purposes
+ If no token is presented, callers first get a token, and then all
  authorization is done based on tokens
+ App developers supported with authentication and authorization services
+ Want to try and minimize the use of all-powerful API keys to communicate
  between services
+ Inter-service calls should instead pass the user's token to other services it
  is calling
    + Through Kong once again

---

### Rationale behind technology choices

+ Ease of implementation and operation as a primary consideration
    + Easy for app teams to implement auth (security as a feature rather than a
      hindrance)
    + Easy for ops teams to administer and operate
        + Will talk to DDs about resourcing this development and engineering ops
          for security

+ Extensibility and ease of integration
    + E.g. plugin support, admin APIs
    + Want to invest in understanding products so that they are easy to extend
      when needed.
    + Want to build the integration layer between technology ourselves
        + Longer term adaptability to our varied requirements without
          overhauling
        + Avoid vendor lock-in

---

### Technology choices

<center><img src="01-technology-choices.svg" width="80%" /></center>

---

### Component: Keycloak

+ Acts as the OAuth authorization server and OpenID Provider
+ Key role in the entire setup is that it is where all the tokens are minted
    + All other services have to trust tokens minted by keycloak (e.g. via
      certificates)
+ It is also where authentication happens
    + Nobody should be running their own authentication after this
    + Use of API keys between services for authentication and authorization
      should be minimized
+ Made my own comparison against CAS, documented everything on GitHub
+ I'm not the only one who thinks CAS is hard to set up
    + https://gist.github.com/bmaupin/6878fae9abcb63ef43f8ac9b9de8fadf

---

### Component: Kong

+ Kong is primarily an API gateway that can be extended in a modular fashion to
  do a variety of things, including auth as such
    + A caller (user or service) tries to access a service through Kong
    + Kong checks if caller presents an access token; if not, then redirect to
      Keycloak for authentication (and grabs access token)
    + Kong then forwards access token to the upstream service

+ Note: Kong's official oauth plugins are for running Kong as the auth server
  (AS) -- this is not we want.

    + Instead, we use a third-party
      [kong-oidc](https://github.com/Revomatico/kong-oidc) plugin to handle
      OAuth's auth code flow.

    + Here Kong behaves like the client in that it exchanges auth code grant for
      access token and also stores sessions and handles refreshing of tokens.

---

### Component: Kong

+ Features we like:
    + Extensible with first-party and community plugins; if need be, writing our
      own plugins seems reasonable and maintainable
    + Admin APIs very useful for integration layer (i.e. RAPID)
    + FOSS version seems to suffice, although we may still benefit from
      enterprise version (need to explore)

---

### Component: Open Policy Agent (OPA)

+ Acts as the policy enforcer
    + App developer packages information, including access token and other app
      level information
    + OPA decides yes/no based on that information, on a familiar http interface
    + (validates the access token)
+ OPA is a single binary, can support both physical machines/VMs and definitely
  as a sidecar in k8s deployments
+ OPA has endpoints for dynamic reading/writing of policy rules
    + Is a key part of policy centralization in OPA

???

+ Use of OPA supersedes Keycloak's own authz services
+ OPA allows *development* of policies to be decentralised, but *management* of
  policies can still be done centrally
+ Validating the access token is a key part of this architecture because we need
  to be sure that Keycloak indeed minted the token
+ It is true that exposing policy is not the same as centralization but it is a
  very good starting point
    + Given our very varied authorization requirements, apps are likely to have
      to have custom policies
    + With complex policies, OPA serves us well because there is room for
      programmatic manipulation of policies

---

### OPA: Usage patterns

<center><img src="02-openresty-opa.svg" width="80%" /></center>

Apps should try and use this pattern unless their authorization needs require
data outside of what can be easily encapsulated in tokens.

???

These patterns are not unique to container deployments. Think of the shapes as
different services running on a VM.

This is the usage pattern we prefer
+ It decouples authorization from the main application almost completely
+ Encourages good API design in the organization of resources and using HTTP
  methods suitably
+ Easy testing, because app devs can test assuming that any traffic even
  reaching the app is already authorized

> Thanks Shawn for this question!

Why is OPA on the app side, why not get Kong to ask OPA for auth information and
skip having another proxy?

We might want to explore that in future.

In the near term, OPA needs to validate the token to prevent spoofing of roles
in a spoofed jwt after bypassing kong.

A valid token is how we establish trust between Kong and the app now. If we use
other ways of establishing trust, such as mTLS or point to point firewall rules,
then we might want to shift the authorization done by OPA over to Kong.

---

### OPA: More complex authorization

<center><img src="03-app-opa.svg" width="80%" /></center>

Apps can use this if the app maintains data that contributes to OPA's decision.

???

Eg from OPA's docs: "Suppose your policy says that only a fileâ€™s owner may
delete it. The authentication system does not track resource-ownership, but the
system responsible for files certainly does."

We want to make sure that close to all authorization decisions are made by OPA,
for centralization and audit purposes.

Even whitelisted paths should first go to OPA for a decision to be made.

---

### Also considered using Keycloak auth services for authorization

+ Keycloak auth services is a Keycloak-provided service
+ Libraries/adapters are provided for apps to connect to keycloak to ask yes/no
    + 1st-party Java adapter support, 3rd party
    + Every call to the app requires an external call to Keycloak, barring
      caching
+ Pros: UI and API for managing the auth policies at keycloak
+ Cons
    + In actual implementation, there are inconsistencies in policy enforcement
    + Auth svcs not as flexible in terms of policies, and custom policies
      require uploading of jars to Keycloak

---

### Extensibility considerations: API keys

+ Still want API keys for programming access by users (e.g. from curl or
  Jupyter)
    + By DSc teams and ATDs; primarily to support data exploration
+ API keys need to translate to access tokens somehow to take advantage of the
  centralised auth
    + API keys only authn users and not provide authz details

---

### Extensibility considerations: API keys

+ Possible implementation options:
    1. Client library acting as UA in auth code flow
        + Pros
            + Transparent to user while maintaining "one API call"
        + Cons
            + Maintenance of new language-specific libraries
            + Potential of leaking user/pass (vs leaking more constrained API keys)
    2. "Shadow client" with client credentials flow (with one Keycloak client per user (per api))
    3. "Shadow client" with resource owner cred flow (with one Keycloak client per
       api)
    4. Kong plugin to exchange API key for token

+ Current preference for option 1

---

### Extensibility considerations: API Gateway Architecture

+ API gateway architecture for the immediate future
+ May want to move to other archtectures to leverage mesh offerings in future
    + For now we have to take into account non-k8s services
    + Gateways are more well understood still
+ On a conceptual level nothing should change
    + Provide authentication and authorization as services - both should stay
      outside the application as much as possible

???

Even if we move to Istio for example, we will just perhaps issue sidecars to
replace the gateway

---

### Extensibility considerations: Automated sign on based on OS creds

+ Automated sign on is a layer on top of this
+ Enable a flag in Chrome to allow Chrome to pass creds over SPNEGO to KC for
  authentication
+ Everything else remains the same because applications continue to rely on
  access tokens

---

### Extensibility considerations: Zero Trust

+ Multi-factor authentication
    + Keycloak supports OTP already
    + RedHat is backing Keycloak and is likely to provide authentication as the
      industry thinks is valuable
    + Provides Authentication SPI (Service Provider Interface) for any future
      custom authentication that we might dream of
+ Device authentication is one part of Zero Trust that we don't have
    + It can be implemented with a client side component adding information
      about the device for the authorization server to verify
    + Keycloak is definitely extensible to support additional verification

---

### Implementation phases

1. Roll out Keycloak and Kong
2. Help app to onboard
3. Migrate users and verify in production
4. Run app to understand engineering ops challenges
5. Focus on making TLS available for developers to secure traffic all the way
6. ... layer on extensions later ...
